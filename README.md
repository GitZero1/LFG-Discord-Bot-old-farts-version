* TODO add something to handle if a user creates a LFG, never joins the VC and then cancels the LFG.  It will need to make sure the VC is empty first, otherwise it can just be ignored and will clean itself up 
* TODO handle extra game modes and private games
* TODO add a way to quickly assign rank/region via the bot for users who dont have it set already
* maybe more drop downs?
* TODO add the current 2max 3max etc to the database manually so the bot keeps managing them after update
* TODO figure out a way to not use names until after discord changes names
* TODO consider adding color coded stuff for ranked/unranked/private/extramodes
* TODO figure out how to handle private matches (how long before its removed? how to handle the VC? do we allow more than 6 users? do we need ranks?)
